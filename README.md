# Terraform Portfolio Project

This project demonstrates how to deploy a static single-page application using **Next.js**, **Terraform**, and **AWS**. The goal is to showcase hands-on experience with Infrastructure as Code (IaC) by provisioning cloud infrastructure for hosting a frontend web app.

## 🚀 Stack Used

- **Next.js** – For building a static single-page site
- **Terraform** – To automate AWS infrastructure setup
- **AWS S3** – For static site hosting
- **AWS CloudFront** – For CDN and global content delivery

## 📁 Project Structure

- `terraform-js/` – Contains Terraform configuration files
- Frontend app files in the root (built with Next.js)

## 🔗 Live Deployment

This project is for educational and demonstration purposes only. No live site is deployed, but all code is ready for deployment.

## 📌 Purpose

To practice:
- Static site deployment on AWS
- Working with Terraform state and file structure
- Setting up CloudFront and S3 for scalable delivery
- Pushing changes to GitHub for version control
